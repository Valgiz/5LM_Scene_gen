# Driving scenario generation and evaluation using a structured layer representation and foundational models.

Rare and challenging driving scenarios are critical for autonomous vehicle development. Since they are difficult to encounter, simulating or generating them using generative models is a popular approach. Following previous efforts of structuring driving scenario representations in a layer model, we propose a structured five-layer model to improve evaluation and generation of rare scenarios. We use this model alongside large foundational models to generate new driving scenarios using a data augmentation strategy. Unlike previous representations, our structure introduces subclasses and characteristics for every agent of the scenario, allowing us to compare them using an embedding in our layer-model space. We study and adapt two metrics to evaluate the relevance of a synthetic dataset in the context of a structured representation: the diversity score estimates how different the scenarios of a dataset are from one another, while the originality score calculates how similar a synthetic dataset is from a real reference set. This paper showcase both metrics in different generation setup, as well as a qualitative evaluation of synthetic videos generated from structured scenario descriptions.

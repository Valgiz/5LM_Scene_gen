## Abstract
Rare and challenging driving scenarios are critical for autonomous vehicle development. Since they are difficult to encounter, simulating or generating them using generative models is a popular approach. Following previous efforts of structuring driving scenario representations in a layer model, we propose a structured five-layer model to improve evaluation and generation of rare scenarios. We use this model alongside large foundational models to generate new driving scenarios using a data augmentation strategy. Unlike previous representations, our structure introduces subclasses and characteristics for every agent of the scenario, allowing us to compare them using an embedding in our layer-model space. We study and adapt two metrics to evaluate the relevance of a synthetic dataset in the context of a structured representation: the diversity score estimates how different the scenarios of a dataset are from one another, while the originality score calculates how similar a synthetic dataset is from a real reference set. This paper showcase both metrics in different generation setup, as well as a qualitative evaluation of synthetic videos generated from structured scenario descriptions.

## Video generation example with Veo3

Real reference scene 1 from the nuScenes dataset:
<video src="videos/real_scene.mp4" controls width="640" autoplay muted></video>

Synthetic scene generated by Veo 3 after editing layer 4:
 image-guided:
<video src="videos/gen_l4.mp4" controls width="640" autoplay muted></video>
 non image-guided
<video src="videos/gen1_unguided.mp4" controls width="640" autoplay muted></video>

structured, image-guided:
<video src="videos/veo3_5LM_guided_scene1.mp4" controls width="640" autoplay muted></video>

unstructured, image-guided:
<video src="videos/veo3_unstruct_guided_scene1.mp4" controls width="640" autoplay muted></video>

scene 3:
<video src="videos/scene3.mp4" controls width="640" autoplay muted></video>
